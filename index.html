Here’s a super simple HTML code example that creates a basic webpage with a heading, paragraph, and a link.
Html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Main heading -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <!-- Paragraph text -->
    <p>This is a simple HTML page. You can add text, images, and links here.</p>

    <!-- A clickable link -->
    <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>

How it works:

<!DOCTYPE html> — tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
<html> — wraps the entire page content.
<head> — contains metadata like the title and character encoding.
<body> — contains the visible content (headings, text, links, etc.).
<h1> — main heading.
<p> — paragraph text.
<a> — hyperlink (target="_blank" opens it in a new tab).

If you want, I can make a slightly upgraded version with colors and styling using CSS so it looks nicer.
Do you want me to do that?
